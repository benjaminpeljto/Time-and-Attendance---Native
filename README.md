*Project proposal* (for Advanced Mobile Programming Course): 
  - This React Native mobile app is going to be used as a part of my Senior Design Project.
  - The application's main functionality is the ability to scan a QR code and receive the response. After the response is recieved, it should be displayed to the user.
  - Besides that, the manual attendance request feature is also going to be available. That feature allows a user to manually enter his start/end of working time and submit it, but it will be approved by admin and the user will be notified.
